# Rainmember
Remember remember, the rain of november - A smart and helpful weather forecast Android app, written in Kotlin.

### What is Rainmember?
Rainmember is an Android app that shows you weather forecasts - but in a smart way. It can show you a clear comparative of weather between your current city and another one you choose and store/display weather data so you can plan yourself better. It can also recommend you clothing suitable for the day when your alarm rings, and remember you to dress appropriately via notifications.

### Who can use?
Anyone interested in a weather app integrated with an alarm app that, combined, can give you helpful hints and data about weather, the life, and everything.

### Haven't we been there, done that?
One of our inspirations is the [Swackett](https://sweaterjacketorcoat.com/apps/) app, that also gives us weather forecasts in a funny and different way, but only for iOS. Also, a weather forecast app really isn't much of a novelty. _HOWEVER_, we believe we can have an unique weather/alarm app here that shows you data in a more friendly way, aiming to be practical and help you make most of your day with clever insights, instead of just spitting out numbers and cloud/sun icons.

### Okay, but how does this work?
#TODO

### Who are the evil minds behind all this?
We are two undergraduate students:
- [heitorado](https://github.com/heitorado), who takes care of UI and Services
- [rafaelmotaalves](https://github.com/rafaelmotaalves), who takes care of Database and System Architecture.

But all in all, everybody does a little bit of this and a little bit of that.
