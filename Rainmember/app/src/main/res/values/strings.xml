    <string name="life_suggestion_netflix">It\'s %1$d°C outside and raining. What about making some microwave popcorn (I heard microwaves have a button just for that) and watch something on your favorite streaming platform?</string>
    <string name="life_suggestion_bike_or_walking">It\'s not raining and about %1$d°C outside, temperature which the writer of this recommendation finds pretty comfortable for biking or walking on the park. If you think that too, take that as a suggestion!</string>
    <string name="life_suggestion_picnic">Well, it\'s %1$d°C outside and the weather is clear. Why don\'t you get that checkered towel, a straw basket, fruits, wine, that nice company and go on a picnic?</string>
    <string name="life_suggestion_fondue">%1$d°C and %2$s means just one thing: fondue. Okay, maybe it could mean a thousand other things, but you got it. Just google \'fondue\' and give it a try!</string>
    <string name="life_suggestion_indoor">Maybe %1$d°C is not the best weather for outdoor stuff, but going on indoor activities can be really nice. What about going to a nice restaurant, shopping or even indoor climbing?</string>
